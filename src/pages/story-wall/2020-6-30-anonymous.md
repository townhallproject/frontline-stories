I drove myself to hospital... because I started having really bad pain with whatever burrowing into my palm. I get there, I drove around twice... 3 parking garages, all closed,  not a person in a mile radius! I did finally see two nurses... neither with masks... I asked them nicely where do I park to get some medical help. She pointed in a direction and laughed. Laughed back at her and said nice masks...
Anyway, parked in a no parking area ..by that time I was pissed! Walked to door.  Its locked, walked further to next door, locked... said go to 2nd floor for ER, I went to 2nd floor, another sign says go to front of hospital, so I did that... guess what next sign said... closed go to rear of hospital 4 blocks thataway. I finally got there... big man sleeping in chair, no one at desks, I said you know what I would rather home now and bandage it myself before I go to jail for making a scene... he laughed and said if you go down this hill one block,  turn right into where it says not to park... then walk back then up the hill... and we will get you some help. I said YOU LOST YOUR MIND JUST LIKE THE REST. PEOPLE !!wake up!!! ...they CLOSED THE HOSPITAL TO PEOPLE IN REAL NEED OF HELP SO THEY CAN HELP A BUNCH OF FAKE PATIENTS! I WALKED AROUND 2 OF THE GARAGES YELLING AT TOP OF LUNGS BUT JUST ECHOES. SO YOU PEOPLE THAT WANT TO SUPPORT THIS SHIT, TAKE A RIDE TO THE HOSPITAL... WHEN YOUR CHILD IS SICK AND NEEDS A HOSPITAL AND YOU CARRY HIM OR HER AROUND FOR 45 MINS TO FIND HELP ... THEN TO BE LAUGHED AT... THEN WE WILL SEE WHO SUPPORTS WHAT I AM SAYING...
since then I have drove to 3 cities and 4 hospitals, same thing... even during the day!!
