story: A little less reported on, but still important, in cities where the
  number of cases is over 50% black and the demographics of that city is over
  50% I think should be compared to similarly-sized cities that are over 50%
  non-black. The comparison would expose geographically related health
  disparities rather than person-by-person cases disparities by percentage. It
  would expose how entire cities that are abundantly black could be WIPED OUT by
  this pandemic.
